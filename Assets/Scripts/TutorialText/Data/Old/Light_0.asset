  - A dusty landscape surrounds you as the sun beats down on you.  Use your mouse
    or  trackpad to look around.
  - The dry ground cracks under your nimble feet. Can this forest even be saved? 
    Move with WASD or arrow keys.
  - Something glows bright in your vision, and you're drawn to it! Curiousity overtakes
    you as you walk right through it.
