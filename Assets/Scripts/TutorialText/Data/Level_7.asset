  - "You\u2019re at the top of the tree! Look around at the vibrant forest around
    you!  To finish your mission, your end goal is to get to the water power so that
    you can navigate that platform  that is filled with fire spirits!  But before
    you do that, make sure you fully explore the level, and you may even use the
    sunflowers as stairs."
