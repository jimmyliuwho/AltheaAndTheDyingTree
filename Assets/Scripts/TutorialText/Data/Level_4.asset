  - "Be careful of the fire spirits on this tree branch! You\u2019re going to need
    light power to get up to that higher ledge, and then once you have water power,
    lure the enemies into the river to kill them! Once you\u2019ve done that, go
    ahead and get that light power back and jump around all parts of the tree to
    collect all the pinecones and grow all the plants in this level."
