  - Move with WASD or arrow keys.  Use your mouse or trackpad to rotate the camera. 
    Walk towards the light element to obtain the power of that element.  With light
    power, you can walk through sun energy fields.  You can also click to shoot light
    energy and grow plants!  Up ahead are some plants, so try growing them as a way
    to heal the forest.  Anytime you see a plant, heal it with light!
